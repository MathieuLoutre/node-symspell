/// Copyright Â©2015-2018 SoftWx, Inc.
/// The inspiration for creating highly optimized edit distance functions was
/// from Sten Hjelmqvist's "Fast, memory efficient" algorithm, described at
/// http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/13525/Fast-memory-efficient-Levenshtein-algorithm
/// The Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm is basically the Levenshtein algorithm with a
/// modification that considers transposition of two adjacent characters as a single edit.
/// The optimized algorithm was described in detail in my post at
/// http://blog.softwx.net/2015/01/optimizing-damerau-levenshtein_15.html
/// Also see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance
/// Note that this implementation of Damerau-Levenshtein is the simpler and faster optimal
/// string alignment (aka restricted edit) distance that difers slightly from the classic
/// algorithm by imposing the restriction that no substring is edited more than once. So,
/// for example, "CA" to "ABC" has an edit distance of 2 by a complete application of
/// Damerau-Levenshtein, but has a distance of 3 by the method implemented here, that uses
/// the optimal string alignment algorithm. This means that this algorithm is not a true
/// metric since it does not uphold the triangle inequality. In real use though, this OSA
/// version may be desired. Besides being faster, it does not give the lower distance score
/// for transpositions that occur across long distances. Actual human error transpositions
/// are most likely for adjacent characters. For example, the classic Damerau algorithm
/// gives a distance of 1 for these two strings: "sated" and "dates" (it counts the 's' and
/// 'd' as a single transposition. The optimal string alignment version of Damerau in this
/// class gives a distance of 2 for these two strings (2 substitutions), as it only counts
/// transpositions for adjacent characters.
/// The methods in this class are not threadsafe. Use the static versions in the Distance
/// class if that is required.</remarks>
